# MetalInMotion

Developed with Unreal Engine 5.1.

A rolling ball demo from https://www.udemy.com/course/pro-unreal-engine-game-coding/.

This is basically my first Unreal project.
I mostly tried to learn the engine and c++ without much polishing on the game.
I replaced nearly 90% of the course code(movement, dash, game end, and a plenty of code cleaning-refactoring).
There is flaws of course,like scripts are not correctly foldered, not using TObjPtr<>, sounds can be better, scripts can be more readable.
